## Getting Started

First, clone the repo and install the dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/reddio-com/reddio-nft-marketplace.git
```

```sh
cd reddio-nft-marketplace
```

Update node to the version you have in package.json file.

```sh
yarn
```

Next, run a local Ethereum node:

```sh
npx hardhat node
```

Deploy the smart contract to the local node:

```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

Running the above command should print out the addresses where the contract was deployed. Update `.evn.local` with those values:

```javascript
NEXT_PUBLIC_NFTMARKET_ADDRESS="your-nft-market-address"
NEXT_PUBLIC_NFT_ADDRESS="your-nft-address"
```

Create an account at [Infura](https://www.infura.io/), create a project and enable Dedicated Gateways, update the values below in '.evn.local' accordingly.

```javascript
NEXT_PUBLIC_IPFS_PROJECT_ID="your-infura-project-id"
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY_SECRET="your-infura-project-secret"
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Notes: Make sure you choose the right network on your Metamask
